# Whistler wave simulation repository
This repository host whistler wave simulation code, which was 
used to generate synthetic whistlers with noise. These whistlers 
closely resembled actual whistlers with respect to attributes needed
to train Machine learning models. The example results for this
code are shown below with the label "synthetic whistler" whereas the 
label "real whistler" shows an actual measured whistler wave with noise.
