# Whistler wave simulation repository
This repository hosts whistler wave simulation code, which was used to generate synthetic whistlers with noise. These simulated whistler waves closely resemble actual whistlers with respect to the attributes needed to train machine-learning models. The example result plot for this code is shown below with the label 'Synthetic whistler with noise' whereas the label 'Real whistler with noise' shows an actual measured whistler wave with noise.
